# Finder's Fishers

A simple datapack for 1.21+ that adds a variety of bundles with custom loot to the fishing loot tables.

## Development Note

This is mostly a proof of concept at this point, but it functions and adds a little flavor to the world. Currently available bundle loot is largely based on pre-existing fishing loot, with a few rarer extras. I plan to add more and more varried bundles if folks show interest in the project.
