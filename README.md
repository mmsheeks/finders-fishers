# Finder's Fishers

A simple datapack for 1.21+ that adds a variety of bundles with custom loot to the fishing loot tables.

## Features

- Fisher's bundles can be fished out of any body of water you can normally fish in and are more likely to drop with Luck of the Sea
- Fished bundles drop a random color
- Bundles have a variety of different loot, with some treasure options
- Bundle loot is balanced to be helpful to players, but not too overpowered
